## Exercise - Types and Type Safety
 
 Declare two variables, one called `firstDecimal` and one called `secondDecimal`. Both should have decimal values. Look at both of their types by holding Option and clicking the variable name.
 */
var firstDecimal = 1.3
var secondDecimal = 2.3

//:  Declare a variable called `trueOrFalse` and give it a boolean value. Try to assign it to `firstDecimal` like so: `firstDecimal = trueOrFalse`. Does it compile? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
var trueOrFalse = true
print("This will not compile because you cannot assign a boolean to a double")
//:  Declare a variable and give it a string value. Then try to assign it to `firstDecimal`. Does it compile? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
var word = "the"
print("This will not compile because you cannot assign a string to a double")
//:  Finally, declare a variable with a whole number value. Then try to assign it to `firstDecimal`. Why won't this compile even though both variables are numbers? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
var wholeNumber = 2
print("This code will not compile because you cannot assign an integer to a double")
